Reflection:
I started this course with no prior knowledge of machine learning, but I was very excited to learn. As I learned about different machine learning models, their advantages and disadvantages, and used them on my own datasets to further explore their uses, I was able to learn more about this field. I also got to learn a new programming language, R, which was very fun since I enjoy coding. By familiarizing myself with different models used in machine learning and neural network models, I was able to explore the possibilities and applications of machine learning, and understood have complex and interesting it is.
I plan to keep learning and both dive deeper into the topics I learned in this course and explore other areas in machine learning. I believe that machine learning is a fascinating field that will keep growing in the future, and given the rapid pace at which is it advancing, I will have to keep learning and expanding my knowledge of it. There are many interesting career paths that utilize machine learning, such as a data scientist, artificial intelligence-focused careers, and cybersecurity, which are all very interesting fields that I would like to explore, especially cybersecurity.
